          The association considered the need to assist brilliant but indigent students in the area of their academic exercise. For now only five (5) students (one from each of the five schools) have benefitted from this particular event. The association catered for their school fees, hostel accommodation and little stipends for feeding. It is the hope of the alumni to sustain the programme but for paucity of fund.
